| Property | Description |
| :: | :: |
| `username` | This is guaranteed to be unique even across casings. Valid usernames match `/^[a-zA-Z_-][a-zA-Z0-9_-]{2,20}$/`. |
| `usernameLowercase` | Lowercased versions of usernames are stored so we can efficiently query whether a username exists. This means we don't have to do case insensitive searches! |
| `id` | This is a unique auto-incrementing integer for the user, and is completely immutable. |
| `socialMedia` | Contains popular social media sites and a way of referencing that user. |
| `lastSeen` | The last time this user made a request to Tachi. |
| `joinDate` | The time this user joined the site. |
| `about` | This user's about me. This is evaluated as markdown. |
| `status` | This users status. This is a short text field. |
| `customPfp`, `customBanner` | Whether this user has a custom profile picture and banner. |
| `clan` | Currently unused. This will store a users clan tag if they are in a clan. |
| `badges` | An array of badges for this user. This contains things like "beta" and "alpha" tester indicators. |
| `authLevel` | This users auth level. This is an enum stored inside tachi-common. 0 = Banned, 1 = Normal User, 2 = Moderator, 3 = Admin. |
