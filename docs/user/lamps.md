# What are Lamps?

Lamps are a term borrowed mainly from Arcade rhythm games.

Their name is derived from the visual implementation in
IIDX and DDR, where a lamp would light up a specific
colour depending on how you cleared the chart.

A synonym for this that might make more sense is "clear type", and some games use this name internally.

## Examples

In most games, you have a "FULL COMBO", which means you
didn't miss. That would be a different lamp to a "CLEAR",
which would generally refer to clearing the chart normally.

Another common lamp is "FAILED", which is exactly what
you think it would be.

## Why Bother?

Some players like to go for lamps, especially in games like BMS
and IIDX, where scoring and lamping[^1] are fairly separate skills.
Keeping track of your lamps is important for a lot of games, and generally
a cool thing!

[^1]: Lamping is the colloquial term for 'going for lamps' rather than going for score.
