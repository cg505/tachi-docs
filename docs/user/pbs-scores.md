# What's the difference between a PB and a Score?
A PB is all of your best scores on that chart joined together.

In most games, this means joining your best score with your best lamp.

!!! note
	Some games have some additional properties - like BP in IIDX and BMS - that
	also need to be joined.

## Why bother?

It would *suck* if you could overwrite good scores with slightly worse ones,
and people would **NEVER** agree on what the primary metric for a games was.

If you got a better lamp on a chart in BMS, and it ruined your existing *sick*
score, that would be terrible!

!!! example
	As an example, consider the following scores.

	| Score | Lamp |
	| :: | :: |
	| 5000 | CLEAR |
	| 4000 | HARD CLEAR |
	
	Your PB on this chart would then therefore be:

	| Score | Lamp |
	| :: | :: |
	| 5000 | HARD CLEAR|

	As it joins the best score with the best lamp!
