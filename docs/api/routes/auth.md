# Internal Authentication

These endpoints relate to internal authentication methods. Read the warning below.

!!! danger
	This is **NOT** for external use. You should **NEVER**
	be requesting a username and password from a user.

	Furthermore, interacting with this programmatically
	is near-impossible because you need to complete a CAPTCHA.

	Nevertheless, This is documented for completeness' sake.

!!! warning
	All of these endpoints are aggressively rate limited. If you fire a bot at this, you will probably get
	your IP blacklisted. Don't do that.
